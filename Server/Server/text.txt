If you don't want to store the large model file (e.g., `t_model.h5`) in your project directory due to its size, there are a few alternatives you can consider:

### 1. **Host the model on a remote server**
   - **Upload the model to cloud storage** like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage.
   - In your Flask app, you can then fetch the model dynamically when needed. This will reduce the storage burden on your local server.

   Example:
   ```python
   import requests
   from transformers import TFBertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer
   
   # URL of the hosted model (e.g., on AWS S3, GCS, or similar)
   model_url = 'https://path_to_model_bucket/model.tgz'
   
   # You could use a function to download and extract the model on demand
   def download_model():
       response = requests.get(model_url)
       with open('model.tgz', 'wb') as f:
           f.write(response.content)
       # Extract the model (if it's compressed)
       # e.g., with tarfile, zipfile, or other extraction tools
       import tarfile
       with tarfile.open('model.tgz', 'r:gz') as tar:
           tar.extractall(path='./sen_models')
   
   # Now load the model and tokenizer from the extracted files
   model = TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('./sen_models')
   tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('./sen_models')
   ```

   This way, the model is downloaded dynamically when your app is started or when it’s needed. Just make sure to download the model only once and cache it if necessary.

### 2. **Use Hugging Face Model Hub (For Pretrained Models)**
   - If the model you're using is publicly available, you could use Hugging Face's `transformers` library to directly load the model from their Model Hub. Hugging Face hosts many pre-trained models that can be loaded easily by providing the model identifier.

   Example:
   ```python
   from transformers import TFBertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer
   
   # Replace this with the model ID from the Hugging Face Model Hub
   model_name = 'bert-base-uncased'  # Or any other model you are using
   model = TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
   tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
   ```

   This approach eliminates the need to download and store the large model file yourself, as it's served from Hugging Face.

### 3. **Use Docker or Virtual Machines**
   - Another approach is to store your large model file in a Docker container or a virtual machine (VM) that is separate from your local server.
   - Your Flask app can make requests to that server (using HTTP, gRPC, etc.) to load the model and process the data.

   Example:
   You could set up a separate Flask application running on another server (with the large model), and then make HTTP requests from your main Flask app to that server.

### 4. **On-demand Loading**
   If you absolutely need to store the model locally but don’t want it taking up memory all the time, you could load the model on-demand when it’s needed (instead of keeping it loaded in memory permanently).

   Example:
   ```python
   def load_model():
       return TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('./sen_models')

   def predict(input_text):
       model = load_model()  # Load model when prediction is made
       tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('./sen_models')
       inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors='pt')
       outputs = model(**inputs)
       return outputs
   ```

   This ensures the model is only loaded when needed, though it may increase the response time due to loading.

### 5. **Convert the Model to a Smaller Format (e.g., TensorFlow Lite)**
   - If you are using a large TensorFlow model, you can consider converting it to a more lightweight format such as **TensorFlow Lite** or **ONNX**. These formats are optimized for performance and typically result in much smaller file sizes, though you might need to re-train or adapt the model for these formats.

   Example (converting a model to TensorFlow Lite):
   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf
   
   # Load your original model
   model = tf.keras.models.load_model('t_model.h5')
   
   # Convert to TensorFlow Lite
   converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
   tflite_model = converter.convert()
   
   # Save the TFLite model
   with open('model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
       f.write(tflite_model)
   ```

   The TensorFlow Lite model can be significantly smaller than the original model, making it more manageable.

---

In conclusion, the best option depends on your specific constraints (e.g., internet access, server load, etc.). If you prefer to not host the model locally, cloud hosting or using Hugging Face might be ideal. For on-premises solutions, converting the model to a smaller format like TensorFlow Lite or loading it dynamically as needed could be effective.
